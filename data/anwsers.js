    From Wikipedia: In finance, being short in an asset means investing in such a way that the investor will profit if the value of the asset falls.This is the opposite of a more conventional "long" position, where the investor will profit if the value of the asset rises.

    There are several ways of achieving a short position.The most fundamental method is "physical" selling short or short - selling, which involves borrowing assets(often securities such as shares or bonds) and selling them.The investor will later purchase the same number of the same type of securities to return them to the lender.If the price has fallen in the meantime, the investor will have made a profit equal to the difference.Conversely, if the price has risen then the investor will bear a loss.The short seller must usually pay a fee to borrow the securities(charged at a particular rate over time, similar to an interest payment), and reimburse the lender for any cash returns such as dividends that were due during the period of lease.

    To profit from a decrease in the price of a security, a short seller can borrow the security and sell it, expecting that it will be cheaper to repurchase in the future.When the seller decides that the time is right(or when the lender recalls the securities), the seller buys the same number of equivalent securities and returns them to the lender.The act of buying back the securities that were sold short is called covering the short, covering the position, or simply covering.A short position can be covered at any time before the securities are due to be returned.Once the position is covered, the short seller is not affected by subsequent rises or falls in the price of the securities, for it already holds the securities that it will return to the lender.

    All trading is risky.The risk in short - selling is that a stock will continue to rise once you have shorted it, and your loss could potentially be “infinite.” In practice, this never happens - an intelligent trader will always close a short position with a proper stop - loss to contain the risk. 
    
    Buying stocks is also risky.More traders buy stocks than short stocks - and most traders lose money.Therefore, plenty of traders who buy stocks lose a significant amount of money.The biggest priority when trading is to manage risk.A trader who manages his or her risk properly will always stop out of losing positions with a minimal loss.

    There was this dude named Isaac Le Maire, a Dutch fellow, in 1609, who shorted shares in the Dutch East India Company. His attempt to depress the price of the shares failed, and he and his fellow speculators suffered large losses. As a side note, he had 22 children with the same wife.

    Jacob Little, known as The Great Bear of Wall Street, started shorting stocks in 1822. Little was born in Newburyport, Massachusetts, and moved to New York City in 1817, first clerking for Jacob Barker; he then opened his own establishment in 1822, and finally his own brokerage in 1834. A market pessimist, Little made his wealth "bearing stocks",[4] at turns short selling various companies and at others cornering markets to extract profits from other short sellers. Through his great financial foresight Little amassed an enormous fortune, becoming one of the richest men in America and one of the leading financiers on Wall Street in the 1830s and 1840s, but his speculative activities irritated his peers and earned him few admirers. Little lost and remade his legendary fortune multiple times before losing it for good in 1857;[note 1] although a great many owed him enormous debts, he was a generous creditor and never collected them, and at his deathbed in 1865 Little was penniless. Although well-known on the stock market in his time, he was quickly forgotten after his death, and today has been relegated to relative obscurity.

    The term “bear,” referring to short-sellers, comes from an old saying in the 1700s: “Do not sell a bear skin before you have caught the bear.” For some reason the term stuck and the term “bearskin” became synonymous with short-selling. In modern times, “bearskin” was shortened to “bear.”

    Trade Zero is a good broker to start short selling. At Trade Zero, you can short stocks trading above $1 per share. You can start a short selling account with $2,500.

    Cobra trading is a good broker for shorting also, but has a minimum account balance of $27,000. At Cobra, you can short stocks trading under $1 or above $1.
    
    Brokers like Robinhood, Think or Swim, Schwab, Fidelity, Etrade, etc are not good brokers for shorting stocks, and in some cases will not allow it at all. Some of those brokers will say that they allow for shorting stocks but then when you try to do it, they will not have shares available for trading, or will outright reject your order. The best brokers to use for shorting stocks at this time are Trade Zero and Cobra trading.

    Short interest is the number of shares that have been shorted. It can be expressed by a number of shares, or a percentage of float (the total number of shares available for trading). Keep in mind this data is delayed. For NASDAQ stocks, short interest is reported on the 15th of the month, and then released 8 days later than that. Some data analysis firms exist that claim to produce up-to-the-minute information on short interest; the value of this data in making trading decisions is arguably minimal. 

    Short interest for a particular stock can be found on websites like Yahoo! Finance.

    Utilization is the ratio of the number of shares that have been lent out to those that are still available on the securities lending market, given as a percentage. It's essentially a gauge of how much demand short sellers have for shares. A high utilization rate can be seen as a red flag. It indicates that demand for the stock from short sellers is elevated - and this could mean the stock is primed and ready to go up in a short squeeze.`,

    The simple answer is that your open P&L in your open positions will show a negative number.

    A more detailed explanation from Wikipedia: If the short position begins to move against the holder of the short position (i.e., the price of the security begins to rise), money is removed from the holder's cash balance and moved to their margin balance. If short shares continue to rise in price, and the holder does not have sufficient funds in the cash account to cover the position, the holder begins to borrow on margin for this purpose, thereby accruing margin interest charges. These are computed and charged just as for any other margin debit. Therefore, only margin accounts can be used to open a short position.

    You owe the broker an amount equal to the dividend. In practice, this rarely occurs for us because we do not hold long-term short positions.`,
    awnserSs15: `
    If the price of a stock rises considerably, some short sellers have to buy back the stock (also known as “covering their position”). This buying back to close the trade adds more buying pressure to the stock, which then can continue to rise even further. This can cause more short sellers to be “stopped out” or forced to cover their position, which adds to the buying pressure and the stock can continue to rise farther and farther. This upward movement can become significant, causing a stock to rise hundreds of percents in even a day (also called a “parabolic move.”

    Short squeezes can happen naturally - but often are created on purpose. Buyers of stocks (institutions and hedge funds) may notice that the short interest on a stock is high, and then begin to buy the stock, forcing short sellers to buy back the stock to close (cover) their trade. This adds more buying pressure; the stock can continue to rise.

    awnserSs16: `
    The “Regulation SHO” (also known as REG SHO) law was put into effect in 2005 to require short sellers to locate shares before they can execute a short position. 

    When you locate shares before shorting a stock, your broker may “grant you the borrow” and let you do the trade, and then the broker will go out and attempt to locate the shares after the fact (within a 3 day window). But if a stock becomes very difficult to borrow, the broker may not be able to locate the shares, and then the broker may send you a notice that you must close your short position within a period of time (generally, 1-3 days) or risk having the position closed for you. This rarely happens but if you short stocks long enough, you will eventually receive a REG SHO notice. 
    
    Although this sounds unfair, it rarely occurs, and it is part of the business of shorting stocks.

    awnserSs17: `
    If a stock is delisted or suspended (NOT HALTED) while you are short the stock, you will continue to be stuck in that position, and pay borrow fees, while the suspension is in effect. Your broker will be able to help you exit the position (with an associated fee) if this happens. This is a rare occurrence.

    This is a strategy called “shorting against the box” and most retail brokers will not allow it; additionally, the IRS will tax this strategy as if you bought the stock and sold it afterwards, so there is very little advantage to doing it. 

    If you are long a stock and wish to hedge your risk, and if the stock is optionable, you can buy a put on that stock. The put can rise in value if the stock falls, thus offsetting your loss. 
    `,
    awnserSs19: `
    A put option is a contract that will generally gain value if the price of a stock falls. So it is theoretically possible to “short a stock with an option,” if options are available. We do not typically employ this strategy (most of the stocks that we short do not have options).

    Yes, but it can be difficult to locate shares (or expensive to borrow them) since the stock is brand new to the market.

    “Days to cover” refers to the total number of shares shorted divided by the average daily volume of the stock. If the total number of shares short was 100,000 shares, and the daily volume for a stock was 100,000, then the Days to Cover number would be 1. 

    In other words, it refers to the expected number of days required to close out all of the shares that have been shorted in a stock.
    
    Generally, investors and traders believe that a high days to cover number is a bearish indicator for a stock (because a large number of traders are short that stock). However, a high days to cover number also could be a warning of an impending short squeeze - because with so many shares shorted, and so many days that would be needed to close out all those shorted shares, the short sellers could get trapped (squeezed).
     `,
    awnserSs22: `There is no best time of the day to short a stock. However, there are certain times of day when volume is higher in a stock, thus creating more opportunities for short sellers. These times of day are near the market open, and near the market close (or even after the close, during the after hours session).

    The best conditions for shorting a stock are when a company that loses money has a stock that is rising rapidly - thus giving short sellers an opportunity to short the stock before a somewhat inevitable fall.
    `,
    awnserSs23: `The short answer is that Rob loves short selling because there is a huge incentive for terrible, money-losing companies to pump (artificially inflate) the price of their stock so they can issue more shares to raise money (and survive). But the fact of the matter is that a company that loses money will have a very difficult time surviving - and therefore shorting stocks can be a higher-probability strategy.

    Put another way, Rob loves shorting stocks because there are always terrible companies that will attempt to pump up the price of their stocks - it’s simply a numbers game - there are more stocks under $10 that eventually fail than succeed.

    A system 1 trade is a short trade (a bet that a stock will fall). It sets up when a stock jumps 30% or more, generally during the premarket session. In order to qualify for an entry, a system 1 trade should also feature the following elements: 

    It should fall below the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP for short), and close below that level.
    Ideally, the highest volume candle of the day should be a bearish (red) candle. 
    If there is a monthly pivot above price, ideally the stock will have jumped high enough to touch that monthly pivot. This means that the stock has completed a move to a higher profit target and could be ready to fall.
    For a system 1 trade, the stop-loss goes above the highest high of the day so far (this can include the premarket session high).

    A limit order is an instruction to buy or sell only at a price specified by the investor. Limit orders are required in the premarket and after hours sessions.
    `,
    awnserSs26: `
    From Investopedia: A stop order is always executed in the direction that the price is moving. For instance, if the market is moving lower, the stop order is set to sell at a pre-set price below the current market price. Alternatively, if the price is moving higher, the stop order will be to buy once the security reaches a pre-set price above the current market price.

    Stop-loss orders should be in place whenever you have an open position to limit your potential losses.

    A regular stop-loss order is recommended for any live position. A stop-loss order is just what it means—it stops losses. The stop-loss order will remove you from your position at a pre-set level if the market moves against you. Stop-loss orders are critical when you can't actively keep an eye on the market, and it's recommended to always have a stop-loss order in place for any existing position for protection from sudden market news, data releases, and the like.

    For example, let's say you're long (you own it) stock XYZ at $27 and believe that it has the potential to reach $35. However, at price levels below $25, your strategy is invalidated, and you want to get out. You would then place a stop order to sell XYZ at around $25, or slightly lower, to account for a margin of error.

    A stop-entry order is used to get into the market in the direction that it's currently moving. For example, let's say you have no position, but you observe that stock XYZ has been moving in a sideways range between $27 and $32, and you believe it will ultimately move higher.


    In this case, you could place a stop-entry order above the current range high of $32—say at $32.25 to allow for a margin of error—to get you into the market once the sideways range is broken to the upside. Now that you're long, and if you're a disciplined trader, you'll want to immediately establish a regular stop-loss sell order to limit your losses in case the break higher is a false one.
    Continuing from the scenario above, XYZ has broken above the range top at $32, and your stop has been triggered at $32.28—stop orders use the best available market price—making you long in a rising market. The price keeps increasing and hits your first price objective at $35. You may now want to protect your profits in case the market reverses lower. You can accomplish this with a regular stop loss placed at, say, $34. That means you will lock in around $1.72 on the trade ($34.00 – $32.28 = $1.72) if the market turns around. In this case, you used a stop-loss order to protect your profit instead of limiting your loss.

    From Investopedia: A trading halt is a temporary suspension of trading for a particular security or securities at one exchange or across numerous exchanges. Trading can be halted in anticipation of a news announcement, to correct an order imbalance, as a result of a technical glitch, due to regulatory concerns or because the price of the security or an index has moved rapidly enough to trigger a halt based on exchange rules. 

    A stock can halt up or down. A stock halt can last one minute, ten minutes, or even all day.
    
    If you are in a buy trade when a stock halts UPWARD, this is a good thing. This means that the stock was moving up so far, so fast, that market makers were not able to process all of the orders quickly enough. When the stock reopens for trading, it should move higher.
    
    Here is what to do if a stock halts upward when you are in a buy trade: place your profit target using a limit order at the next profit target level higher. If you are using fib retracement levels for your profit target, this will be the next fib level. If you are using Oracle levels or some other levels—then use the next level and place a limit order to take profit at that level. A more conservative / safer method is to simply place a profit target using a limit order at the same price where the stock halted—this will practically ensure that your order to exit is processed when the stock reopens. 
    
    If you choose to stay in a stock that halts upward—you may find that it continues to halt higher and higher throughout the day. This is a riskier form of trading, to keep your order open. If you do this, continue to monitor the stock closely and move your stop upward as the stock climbs. Lower float stocks, especially stocks with a float lower than 500,000 shares, tend to halt multiple times upward. Remember it is possible for the stock to suddenly halt DOWNWARD, and this can instantly eliminate all of your profit and even put your trade into a loss. 
    
    If a stock halts downward, it means that the stock could continue lower in free-fall. If you are in a buy trade when a stock halts downward, it is a good idea to get out of the trade as quickly as possible using a limit order at the halted price or lower, so that as soon as the stock reopens you have a chance to exit. If you are short a stock that halts downward, this is great. This means the stock could continue lower all day long.

    1. Draw a line across the highest high the stock moved today, whether that is the premarket high (also known as PMH), the regular trading hours high (HOD), or the after hours high (AFH). 
    
    2. When the stock breaks above the high line that you drew, that is a buy trade. It is not necessary to wait for a candle to close, or finish forming.
    
    3. The profit target is the next fibonacci level higher - at which point you can exit the trade, or move your stop loss and try for the next fibonacci level higher. You can search for “how to use fibonacci retracements for profit targets on buy trades” for more information.

From Investopedia: In technical analysis, a Fibonacci retracement is created by taking two extreme points (usually a peak and a trough) on a stock chart and dividing the vertical distance by the key Fibonacci ratios of 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 100%.

Once these levels are identified, horizontal lines are drawn and used to identify possible support and resistance levels.

If you are struggling with your trading, do the following:

1. Stop trading for at least a day, and possibly longer. While you stop trading, work on the items on this list.

2. Check your trade size. Are you trading a trade size so big that you are nervous about your trades? Reducing your trade size can immediately improve your trading, as it leads to less emotional trading.

3. Are you placing your stops in the right place? Some traders, in an effort to “better manage risk,” will use a stop so tight they are virtually guaranteed to stop out. If you are worried that the recommended stop loss areas are too big, then reduce the size of your trades.

4. Check your profit target levels. Sometimes a trader will get greedy and place a far-away profit target level that is very difficult for a stock to reach. If you want to build some confidence, consider placing your profit target closer to your entry, getting some wins, and then gradually increasing the profit target level - or taking half your profit target at a nearby level and then letting the rest of the trade run with a stop loss at break even.

5. Check your emotions. Do you feel a significant amount of anxiety when trading? If so, you might consider greatly reducing the size of your trades or even paper trading for a period of time until you feel less anxious about your trades.

6. Are you posting your trade plans in the Trades chat group? The most important prep work you can do for a trade is to post your plans in the group - and get comments on those plans. You can also post a chart with marks on where you entered and exited, plus notes about the trade, in the Results group, so that others can comment and help.

7. Are you trading several systems/alerts? If you are trading too many systems, or following alerts from different sources, you may find that your trading is inconsistent. Is is a good idea to focus on one method at a time, and master that method before moving on to anything else. A good place to start is the Booker Breakout method for buying stocks.

8. Are you following the rules of the strategy / system you are trading? Sometimes, we adjust the entries or exits without really thinking too much about it. Small changes to a system can have a significant effect. Most traders do not realize how important it is to stay on track with a set of rules, and focus on one strategy / system.

const PivotAwnsers = {

To answer that, let’s start with the definition of a monthly pivot point. A monthly pivot point is a horizontal line. I color them purple. It is calculated by adding together last month’s high price, low price, and closing price - and then dividing that number by three.

If last month’s high price was 100, and the low price was 100, and the closing price was 100 (this is technically impossible, but we’ll just say that’s what it was); then we could add those numbers together. That would equal 300. Then we would divide that number by three - and we’d get 100. That would display the monthly pivot at $100 per share. 

Now, for ghost pivots.

A MONTHLY ghost pivot is next month’s pivot that technically hasn’t formed yet, because it is not yet the end of the month. But it is drawn as if the end of the month is right now.

For instance, the July monthly pivot for the stock TSLA cannot (technically) show up on any chart, because we don’t know what the high of June is, the low of June is or the closing price for the month of June is. To really show the July monthly pivot, we need to wait until the market closes on June 30. Then we know what the high, low, and closing prices were for TSLA in June.

I invented a “ghost pivot” so that I could see where the July pivot would be TODAY, if the last day of June were today. I know that today is not the last day of June. But if I wanted to see the July pivot, my ghost pivot indicator would simply calculate the July pivot using the high, low and most recent closing price of TSLA for the month of June.

Price has not touched the pivot either in the month it was created or any subsequent month.

A pivot that has not been hit in the current month (the June pivot during the month of June) is unhit.

A pivot point that was unhit last month, and has not yet been hit (or reached) by price in a subsequent month, is called a missed pivot.

Hit/Unhit is used for the current month.

Missed is a term used for past months.

After the market closes on the last day of the month, a new month’s pivot is created. When the market closes on June 30 (or whatever day the last market day in June is), the July pivot will be created. It cannot move after this time.

I don’t know what your main chart is. So I will answer just with the chart time frame I use pivots on.

But for me, I use a 1 hour or a 4 hour chart to show monthly pivots and monthly ghost pivots.

There are no rules for it. You might use monthly pivots to see where price might be going if it is rising (the monthly pivot point could be a profit target above) or if it is falling (the monthly pivot could be a profit target below).

When I am shorting a stock, I like to make sure there is NO monthly pivot above price, close by, that has NOT been hit. If there is an unhit or missed monthly pivot above price, the stock may not be done rising.
